I followed a 4 day challenge set for me to create a 3 page website UI of Apple.com, further tweaks will be carried out later on.
You are to clone the apple website with the resources given to you. View and download the resources on your dashboard and extract the zip folder and you will find all the images you need.

You are to create three pages:
	1. Index page
	2. ipad Page
	3. Accessories Page

The images for all pages are in their respective folder names. Index page image is found in index page folder, ipad page images are in ipad page folder and accessories page images are in accessories page folder.

There are screenshots of the pages you are to design in the individual folders. The image is called screenshot. Open the screenshot image on your system and see a view of the page you are to design.
